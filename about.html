        This is a question I struggle with when I'm ordering takeout to the point where I miss my chance of placing an order for dinner because it's too late by the time I finally decide. It is just that there are too many incredible 
        
        local restaurants here in Louisville, Kentucky, so it only makes it harder to choose, it never gets easier. 
        
        That's why I decided to make a site that can help me choose what I should get from one of my many favorite local places.
