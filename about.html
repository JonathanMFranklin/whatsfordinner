        This is a question I struggle with when I'm ordering takeout to the point where I miss my chance of placing an order for dinner because it's too late by the time I finally decide. It is just that there are too many incredible 
        
        local restaurants here in Louisville (KY) so it only makes it harder to choose, it never gets easier. Not to mention it drives my friends insane to the point they dread going out to eat with me.
        
        That's why I decided to make a site that can help me (and anyone who has the same issue) choose where to go for dinner. The list is continuously growing as I visit new places. Additionally, if there is a local restaurant that isn't on the current list and you'd recommend, fill out the form below and let me know!
