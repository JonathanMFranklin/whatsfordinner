<h1>"What's for Dinner?"</h1>

<p>This is a question I struggle with when I'm ordering takeout to the point where I miss my chance of placing an order for dinner.

There are a lot of wonderful local restaurants here in Louisville, Kentucky so it only makes it harder to choose, it never gets easier. 

That's why I decided to make a site that can help me choose what I should get from one of my many favorite local places

<h3>CSS features</h3>

    <li>JS function the grabs a ransom suggestion from the array and displays it on the page</li>
    <li>Created a functioning submission form with the use of formspree.io to allow for suggestions from users since site is hosted on github pages- github pages cannot execute server-side. Users are able to enter their email and suggestion that will then be sent to me for review</li>
    </ul>
