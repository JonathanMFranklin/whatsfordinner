<h1>"What's for Dinner?"</h1>

<p>This is a question I struggle with when I'm ordering takeout to the point where I miss my chance of placing an order for dinner. There are a lot of wonderful local restaurants here in Louisville, Kentucky, so it only makes it harder to choose, it never gets easier. That's why I decided to make a site that can help me choose what I should get from one of my many favorite local places.</p>
