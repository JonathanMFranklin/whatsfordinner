"What's for Dinner?" 

This is a question I struggle with when I'm ordering takeout to the point where I miss my chance of placing an order for dinner.

There are a lot of wonderful local restaurants here in Louisville, Kentucky so it only makes it harder to choose, it never gets easier. 

That's why I decided to make a site that can help me choose what I should get from one of my many favorite local places
